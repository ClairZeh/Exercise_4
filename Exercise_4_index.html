        <h3>Plot:</h3>
        <p><b>In</b> Medieval Scotland,<br>
            a young<strong><em> Princess Merida of the clan Dunbroch</em></strong> celebrates her birthday and is given a bow and arrow by her father, King Fergus,<br>
            dismaying his wife Queen Elinor.<br>
            While venturing into the forest to fetch an arrow, Merida encounters a will-o'-the-wisp.<br>
            Soon afterward, Mor'du, a huge demon bear, attacks the family.<br>
            Merida flees on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus and his men fend off Mor'du, though the fight costs the king one of his legs.<br>
            Ten years later, Merida discovers she is to be betrothed to the son of one of her father's allies.<br>
            Elinor explains failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch,<br>
            reminding Merida of a legend of a prince whose pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes destroyed his kingdom.<br>
            The allied clan chieftains and their first-born sons arrive to compete in the Highland games for Merida's hand in marriage.<br>
            Twisting the rules, Merida announces that, as her own clan's firstborn, she will compete for her own hand.<br>
            Merida easily bests her suitors in an archery contest and, after arguing with Elinor, runs away into the forest.<br>
            Wisps appear, leading her to the hut of an elderly witch.<br>
            Merida bargains for a spell to "change" Elinor, and the witch gives her an enchanted cake.<br>
            Elinor eats the cake and is transformed into a bear, unable to speak but still retaining most of her human consciousness.<br>
            Merida returns to the deserted witch's cottage with Elinor, and discovers a message from the witch:<br><br>
            <strong> - Merida must "mend the bond, torn by pride" by the second sunrise, or the spell will become permanent. - </strong><br><br>
            Merida and Elinor are led by the wisps to ancient ruins, where they encounter Mor'du.<br>
            Realizing Mor'du was the prince in the legend, Merida vows to not let the same thing happen to her mother,<br>
            and concludes she needs to repair the family tapestry she deliberately damaged during their argument.<br>
            They return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war.<br>
            Merida intends to relent and declare herself ready to choose a suitor as tradition demands, but at Elinor's prompting,<br>
            she instead allows the firstborns to marry in their own time to whomever they choose.<br>
            The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing and strengthening their alliance.<br>
            Merida sneaks into the tapestry room with Elinor, but Fergus walks in on them. Losing her humanity, Elinor attacks Fergus,<br>
            but suddenly regains her composure and flees the castle.<br>
            Mistaking the Queen for Mor'du, and thinking it has eaten his wife, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans, locking Merida in the castle.<br>
            Merida escapes with the assistance of her identical triplet brothers, Harris, Hubert, and Hamish, who have become bear cubs after eating the enchanted cake.<br>
            Merida repairs the tapestry and pursues her father<br>
            Fergus and the clans capture Elinor, but Merida thwarts them before the real Mor'du arrives.<br>
            Mor'du battles with the clan warriors and targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, holding off Mor'du and causing him to be crushed by a falling menhir.<br>
            This releases the spirit of the prince, who silently thanks Merida for freeing him and transforms into a wisp.<br>
            Merida covers her mother in the repaired tapestry as the sun rises for the second time, but she remains a bear.<br>
            Thinking it was for nothing, Merida reconciles with Elinor begging to have her back,<br>
            unknowingly fulfilling the true meaning of the witch's message and reversing the spell's effects on her mother and brothers.<br>
            With Mor'du gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry.<br>
            After they are called to the docks to bid farewell to the other clans, they ride their horses together.
